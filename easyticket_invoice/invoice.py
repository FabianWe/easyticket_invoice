class Article(object):
    """
    An article in a an invoice.

    An article has a unique id (usually int or str), a name and a description.
    It also has a price that consists of three components (that must be given when the article is initialized):
    net, tax and gross (where gross should be net + tax).
    Just to be sure everything is okay this values must all be given and are not computed automatically.
    But there are some helper functions to compute those values: compute_gross and compute_taxes.

    An article also has a tax category that is used in an invoice to group together articles with the same tax rate.
    This is just a string identifier, for example for a tax of 19% the identifier could be just '19%'.

    Attributes:
        article_id: Id of the article, usually int or str.
        name (str): Name of the article.
        tax_category (str): Identifier for a tax category.
        net (Decimal): The net value of this article.
        tax (Decimal): The taxes included in this article.
        gross (Decimal): The gross value of this article.

    If quantize is given the result will be rounded to a given exponent, for example quantize=Decimal('0.01') means
    round to two digits.
    The idea is to round at the latest moment, meaning to keep everything as accurate as possible as long as possible.
    This might have a small influence, depending on how much rounding is required (usually just one or two cents, but
    we want to be correct).
    The taxes will be computed as accurate as possible, after that with a given quantize value everything is rounded
    to the given exponent. So with quantize=Decimal('0.01') net, taxes and gross are quantized s.t. the returned gross
    value is exactly the sum of net and taxes. Thus, due to some rounding, the exact net value might change.
    This is why this method returns everything: net, taxes and gross (in this order) as Decimal values.

    Args:
        net (Decimal): The net value.

    Because some rounding (if quantize is given) may change the actual gross value, the new gross value is returned

    The invoice contains general information (such as issuer and recipient addresses) as well as information about

    Taxes are grouped in to so called tax categories. For example if you have two different taxes on an invoice, one
    with a tax rate of 19% and one with 7% (German VAT) you could just add two categories, one with name '19%' and value
    Decimal(0.190) and one with name '7%' and value Decimal('0.070'). I've added a leading zero just to be more accurate
    when computing gross values and rounding them afterwards.
    Each article added to an invoice is associated with such a tax group. Before adding an article you should ensure
    that the tax category has been added before (see add_tax_category).

    The articles contained in this invoice are stored in a dictionary mapping the item identifier (usually int or str)
    to a list of articles.
