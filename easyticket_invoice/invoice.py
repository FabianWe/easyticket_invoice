    If quantize is given the result will be rounded to a given exponent, for example quantize=Decimal('0.01') means
    round to two digits.
    The idea is to round at the latest moment, meaning to keep everything as accurate as possible as long as possible.
    This might have a small influence, depending on how much rounding is required (usually just one or two cents, but
    we want to be correct).
    The taxes will be computed as accurate as possible, after that with a given quantize value everything is rounded
    to the given exponent. So with quantize=Decimal('0.01') net, taxes and gross are quantized s.t. the returned gross
    value is exactly the sum of net and taxes. Thus, due to some rounding, the exact net value might change.
    This is why this method returns everything: net, taxes and gross (in this order) as Decimal values.

    Args:
        net (Decimal): The net value.
        tax_rate (Decimal): The tax rate, for example for 19% you could use Decimal('0.190').
        quantize (Decimal): Round to the given exponent (see Decimal.quantize).

    This method computes the net value given the gross value and the tax. If quantize is given the result will be

    Because some rounding (if quantize is given) may change the actual gross value, the new gross value is returned

    The net value is computed as exact as possible, then rounded given the quantized exponent. This might change the
